# Shiny app - Genetic drift simulator

## Purpose

The intention of this Shiny app is completely didactic. It is meant for students to explore the genetic consequences of genetic drift: random sampling, stochastic changes in frequency, and dependency on population size.

It also has a visual purpose so that students get to see in real time how fluctuations in allele frequency happen after each generation. This means that the simulation will run and show an animation of:

1. How allele frequency changes with in a "petri dish". Dots represent individuals and colors represent alleles.
2. A tabulation of allele frequency per generation.

## Availability

The app is also available [here](https://santiagosnchez.shinyapps.io/genetic_drift/) and it should be accessible from anywhere.
